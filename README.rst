tzdata: Python package providing IANA time zone data
====================================================

This is a **FORK** of the Python package containing ``zic``-compiled binaries for the IANA time zone database. It is intended to be a fallback for systems that do not have system time zone data installed (or don't have it installed in a standard location), as a part of `PEP 615 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/>`

The main source repository generates a ``pip``-installable package, published on PyPI as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata>`_.

For more information, see `the documentation <https://tzdata.readthedocs.io>`_.

This fork is done for myself for Syno DSM 7 to function with SickChill which calls on FAT files for info as only SLIM files were available.

The files to do this are in `zonetimeinfo.zip <src/tzdata/zonetimeinfo.zip>`_ file and guide `DSM_task_scheduler <docs/DSM_task_scheduler.md>`_ and includes `ZoneInfoDSM <docs/ZoneInfoDSM.sh>`_ bash file to link to scheduler.

Files are version **2024b** from "https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/"
